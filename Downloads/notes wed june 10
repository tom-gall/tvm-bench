In regards to the ST image: Colm replied to the Git issue I raised saying he was stumped and not sure how much he'd be able to help as they don't see the same failure in their 32bit environment. 

Vincent is helping me to look into this currently.

In the meantime I've been working on seperating the ArmNN package from the ai package Vincent has made for the stm board in order to deploy it to the IMX8 board.

I'm having some computer issues which i need to resolve first though unfortunately.



Pavel:
Pi armnn examples will be updated.
